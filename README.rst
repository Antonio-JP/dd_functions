===================
Sage Sample Package
===================

.. image:: https://mybinder.org/badge.svg
   :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sagemath/sage_sample/master

This package is designed as a simple `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org>`_ package
example to serve as a good practice reference for package developers. We follow
python recommendations and adapt them to the SageMath community. You can find more
advanced documentation on python package creation on
`How To Package Your Python Code <https://packaging.python.org/>`_.

This is still a work in progress. Once this example will have
stabilized, the plan is to make a
`cookie cutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
template out of it.

Installation
------------

Try the `demo <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sagemath/sage_sample/master?filepath=demo.ipynb>`_ on binder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local install from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the source from the git repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sagemath/sage_sample.git

Change to the root directory and run::

    $ sage -pip install --upgrade --no-index -v .

For convenience this package contains a `makefile <makefile>`_ with this
and other often used commands. Should you wish too, you can use the
shorthand::

    $ make install

Install from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

sage_sample is distributed on PyPI. You can install it with the command::

    $ sage -pip install sage_sample

Distribute via PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To distribute your own package on PyPI, you will need an account on
`pypi.org <https://pypi.org/>`_ (maybe at first on
`test.pypi.org <https://test.pypi.org/>`_).

You also need to install setuptools, wheel and twine::

    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel twine

If the README file is in Markdown format, you need to install cmarkgfm as well::

    $ pip install --upgrade cmarkgfm

Then you can generate the distribution package via::

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

*NB:* if the package is both Python 2 and Python 3 compatible, use instead::

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal

Check that everything is all right::

    $ twine check dist/*

Upload the package to the test PyPI repository::

    $ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

Check the package install in Sage::

    $ sage -pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple sage_sample

And later, upload your distribution to the real PyPI [optionally sign it with GPG]::

    $ twine upload [-s] dist/*


Usage
-----

Once the package is installed, you can use it in Sage with::

    sage: from sage_sample import answer_to_ultimate_question
    sage: answer_to_ultimate_question()
    42

See also the `demo notebook <demo.ipynb>`_.

Setup
------

All packaging setup is done through ``setup.py``. To create your own package
follow the strcuture of the file and change the parameters accordingly.

Source code
-----------

All source code is stored in the folder ``sage_sample`` using the same name as the
package. This is not mandatory but highly recommended for clarity. All source folder
must contain a ``__init__.py`` file with needed includes.

Tests
-----

This package is configured for tests written in the documentation
strings, also known as ``doctests``. For examples, see this
`source file <sage_sample/ultimate_question.py>`_. See also
`SageMath's coding conventions and best practices document <http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#writing-testable-examples>`_.
With additional configuration, it would be possible to include unit
tests as well.

Once the package is installed, one can use the SageMath test system
configured in ``setup.py`` to run the tests::

    $ sage setup.py test

This is just calling ``sage -t`` with appropriate flags.

Shorthand::

    $ make test

Documentation
-------------

The documentation of the package can be generated using Sage's
``Sphinx`` installation::

    $ cd docs
    $ sage -sh -c "make html"

Shorthand::

    $ make doc

For this to work on your own package, make sure you follow the same
structure as we do here:

* Create a ``docs`` folder containing the exact same ``Makefile`` and a ``source``
  folder.
* Copy and paste the ``docs/source/conf.py`` file from this package and update
  the few project specific variables at the beginning of the file.
* Create an ``index.rst`` file as well as a ``<module name>.rst`` file for each
  module you want on the documentation.

Travis CI integration
---------------------

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/sagemath/sage_sample.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/sagemath/sage_sample

Scripts that run ``make test`` on various SageMath versions on the
Travis CI system are included.
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners explains how to enable
automatic Travis CI builds for your GitHub-hosted project.

The scripts download and install binary releases (7.1-7.4) from a
SageMath mirror.  Edit ``.travis-install.sh`` if some optional or
experimental SageMath packages need to be installed prior to running
your package.  Edit ``.travis.yml`` to change the list of SageMath
versions used.

Automatically deploying documentation to GitHub pages using Travis CI
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* First do the steps described above to enable Travis CI integration
  of your GitHub-hosted project.

* If you don't already have GitHub pages for your project: Create and
  checkout a branch ``gh-pages`` in your repository and put an empty
  file ``.nojekyll`` in it (see
  https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing/).
  Then commit it and push it to GitHub::

    $ git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/USER/PROJECT.git gh-pages
    $ cd gh-pages
    $ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    $ git rm -rf .
    $ touch .nojekyll
    $ git add .nojekyll
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
    $ git push -u origin gh-pages
    $ cd ..

* (Back in your working copy:) Generate a new ssh key pair with an
  empty passphrase::

    $ ssh-keygen -t dsa -f .travis_ci_gh_pages_deploy_key

* Add the public ssh key (contents of the file
  ``.travis_ci_gh_pages_deploy_key.pub``) to your GitHub repository
  as a deploy key (Settings/Deploy keys/Add deploy key).
  Title: Key for deploying documentation to GitHub pages.
  Check Allow write access.

* Install the Travis CI command-line client from
  https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb::

    $ gem install travis

* Log in to Travis CI using your GitHub credentials::

    $ travis login

* Encrypt the private ssh key, add the decryption keys
  as secure environment variables to Travis CI, and
  add code to ``.travis.yml`` to decrypt it::

    $ travis encrypt-file .travis_ci_gh_pages_deploy_key --add before_script

* Add the encrypted private ssh key to the repository::

    $ git add .travis_ci_gh_pages_deploy_key.enc

* Have git ignore the other keys (and the gh-pages directory)::

    $ echo >> .gitignore
    $ echo "/.travis_ci_gh_pages_deploy_key" >> .gitignore
    $ echo "/.travis_ci_gh_pages_deploy_key.pub" >> .gitignore
    $ echo "/gh-pages" >> .gitignore
    $ git add .gitignore

* Optionally, edit ``.travis.yml`` to adjust variables ``DEPLOY_DOC_...``

* Commit all changes to GitHub.  The Travis CI build should then run
  automatically and deploy it::

    $ git add .travis.yml
    $ git commit -m "Deploy built documentation to GitHub"
    $ git push

* The deployed documentation will be available at:
  https://USER.github.io/PROJECT/
  This can be customized by changing ``DEPLOY_DOC_TO_DIRECTORY=/``
  to another directory in ``.travis.yml``
  For example, setting ``DEPLOY_DOC_TO_DIRECTORY=doc/html`` will make
  the deployed documentation available at:
  https://USER.github.io/PROJECT/doc/html/
