Differentially Definable functions on Sage
================================================

Differentially definable functions is a mathematical concept that allows to represent 
functions on the computer symbolically. Giving a field `\mathbb{K}`, and the ring of
formal power series `\mathbb{K}[[x]]`, we can represent those power series
that satisfy a linear differential equation.

This package allows Sage user to work with this representation and manipulate these
functions. For further information, see the related bibliography:

* `Some structural results on Dn-finite functions <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196885820300300>`_

To use this module, it is enough to import it with the following Sage line::

    from ajpastor.dd_functions import *

From this site, you can explore all the documentation (which contains several examples of usage) for all
the modules included in this package.
